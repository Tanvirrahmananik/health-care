           <h2> WHAT IS LYMPHOEDEMA AND WHO DOES IT AFFECT?</h2>
           <h4>Lymphoedema is the build-up of fluid in the body due to a compromised lymphatic system. The fluid usually builds up slowly over time and can be anywhere in the body, but most commonly in the arm or leg. It can be a side effect of cancer surgery, where they remove the lymph nodes (often in the groin or underarm) or be a chronic condition that you are born with.</h4>
           <h2>How do I know I have lymphoedema?</h2>
           <h4>You’ll usually get the diagnosis from your doctor or oncologist and early signs and symptoms are:
      <p>A general ache in the limb with a vague heaviness.Decreased movement in the limb.Tightness of jewellery, shoes or clothes.Swelling in the limb.Recurring skin infections in the area</p>
</h4>
<h2>What do I do if I have these symptoms?</h2>
<h4>Lymphoedema is very manageable if caught early and if you notice any of these symptoms then speak to your GP or oncologist. Ongoing management will require a referral to an accredited lymphoedema therapist which will continue with your ongoing treatment</h4>
<h2>What does treatment involve?</h2>
<h4>Treatment can greatly reduce swelling, reduce pain/discomfort and improve the function of the limb. Along with your doctor or oncologist, accredited lymphoedema therapists can use a range of techniques to help you manage your symptoms and take back control</h4>
